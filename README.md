# Cursor Grid Teleport

_A blazingly fast keyboard cursor positioning plugin that uses a fixed and predictable grid making it easy to develop muscle memory._

## Overview

**Cursor Grid Teleport** is an AwesomeWM plugin that allows users to quickly reposition the mouse cursor using a predefined, fixed grid layout on the screen. By activating a dedicated "Cursor Mode", users can press keys corresponding to specific screen sections to instantly move the cursor there. The plugin integrates a transparent grid overlay, providing clear visual feedback of the current grid layout.

This predictable grid layout helps in building muscle memory, enabling fast and efficient cursor repositioning without the need to visually locate target areas on the screen.

## Features

- **Cursor Mode for Instant Cursor Positioning:**  
  A single key teleports your mouse cursor to a specific grid section.

- **Transparent Grid Overlay:**  
  Displays a semi-transparent grid with labels while in Cursor Mode to guide cursor movement.

- **Muscle Memory Friendly:**  
  Fixed grid layout makes it easier to develop muscle memory for fast cursor navigation.

- **Easy Activation/Deactivation:**  
  Toggle the Cursor Mode using a single key combination.

## Roadmap

- **Basic Configuration:**  
  Allow user to define their preferred shortcut and teleport keys.

- **Precise Positioning:**  
  "Precise Cursor Mode" will use two keys but take you even closer to your target by drawing a secondary scaled grid centered on your initial teleport position.

- **Theming and Style Customization via AwesomeWM `beautiful`:**  
  Integrate styling options with AwesomeWMâ€™s theming system, allowing customization of colors, fonts, and transparency by passing a simple configuration `lua` table.

- **Dynamic Grid Geometry for Multi-monitor Setups:**  
  Implement dynamic updates to the grid geometry to accommodate multi-monitor configurations and resolution changes.

- **Expanded Functionality and Custom Shortcuts:**  
  Add support for additional keyboard shortcuts, customizable grid layouts, and extended actions for specific grid cells.

## Usage

1. **Activate the `Cursor Mode`:**  
   Press `Mod4 + Shift + u` and a transparent grid shows the `teleport keys` available in each section.

2. **Move the Cursor:**  
   Press any of the `teleport keys` and the cursor will instantly jump to the center of the selected cell.

- **Deactivate `Cursor Mode`:** The mode automatically deactivates after moving the cursor or if you press the `Escape` key.

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository into your AwesomeWM configuration directory. For example:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cursor-grid-teleport.git ~/.config/awesome/cursor-grid-teleport
   ```

2. Ensure all required dependencies are installed (`awful`, `gears`, `naughty`, `wibox`, `lgi`, etc.). These are typically included with AwesomeWM or can be installed via your package manager.

3. Add or update your AwesomeWM configuration to include the plugin. In your `rc.lua` or equivalent configuration file, require the plugin:

   ```lua
   require("cursor-grid-teleport")
   ```

4. Reload AwesomeWM to apply changes.

## Configuration

You can customize aspects of the plugin directly in the `init.lua` file:

### Grid Appearance

Adjust `bg` in the `grid_wibox` definition for background color/transparency.

```lua
local grid_wibox = wibox({
...
bg = "#0000b0" .. "55", -- color and transparency
fg = "#FFFF00",
})
```

### Grid Labels Appearance

Change `cr:set_source_rgba()` and `cr:set_font_size()` values in the drawing function to modify line/text colors and font size.

```lua
-- Teleport key labels
cr:select_font_face("Sans", cairo_lgi.FontSlant.NORMAL, cairo_lgi.FontWeight.BOLD)
cr:set_font_size(34)
cr:set_source_rgba(1, 1, 0, 1) -- R G B Alpha (0 - 1)
```

### Keybindings

```lua
-- Global binding
local globalkeys = gears.table.join(
  awful.key(
    { "Mod4", "Shift" },
    "u",
    toggle_cursor_mode,
    { description = "Activate Cursor Mode", group = "custom" }
  )
)
```

### Grid Size and `teleport keys`

The grid layout is defined in the `teleport_keys` table. Modify this table to change the keys or grid structure.

```lua
local teleport_keys = {
 { "q", "w", "e", "r", "t", "y", "u", "i", "o", "p" },
 { "a", "s", "d", "f", "g", "h", "j", "k", "l", "~" },
 { "z", "x", "c", "v", "b", "n", "m", ",", ".", "/" },
}
```

### Special keys handling

```lua
-- Special keys handling

if key == "dead_tilde" or key == "asciitilde" then
  key = "~"
end
```
